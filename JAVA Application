Fork and clone below Java Project Repository

Java Web Demo App
Create Build for Java based App using below Maven Command

mvn clean — Delete the previously compiled java files and 
resources(Files inside the target folder will be deleted)

mvn compile — Compile the source java classes. If you need to compile the test classes 
of the maven project, you can use the “compiler:testCompile” command.

mvn package — Wrap the source code into a file format which 
we can share or distribute (eg:war, jar). Simply converts in to an executable java program.

mvn install — Install the package or the wrapped compiled 
code(jar or war file)in our local repository. So we can use it for our other projects as well.

mvn test — Run tests using an unit test framework and you 
can see the output in console.

mvn deploy — Install or copy the final package to a remote 
repository. So other developers also can use it.

mvn dependency:tree
This command generates the dependency tree of the Maven project

mvn dependency:analyze
This command analyzes the maven project to identify the unused declared and used undeclared dependencies:
